MICRODEM help file at https://www.usna.edu/Users/oceano/pguth/md_help/html/microdem.htm

All files in this top level folder are duplicates, and potentially old.  Do not use.  There is not easy way to delete them so I am slowing working on it.

This is about 400,000 lines of Delphi code, going back to the first iteration of Turbo Pascal.

If you want to work with the code, I suggest you contact me. The code was not written with the intention of getting to where it is now, and I am working to refactor it to make the variables names more consistent, and to eliminate duplications of code.  Unless I know someone is working on parts of the code, I might make major "improvements" that could make your life difficult.
