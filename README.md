MICRODEM help file at https://www.usna.edu/Users/oceano/pguth/md_help/html/microdem.htm

This is about 400,000 lines of Delphi code, going back to the first iteration of Turbo Pascal.  This can be compiled with the free community edition of Delphi.

There are two directories with compiled executables for Windows 64
--aa_setup_update has a full install, with required support databases. amd an update version with just the executable which might be updated more often.
--compoiled_exe_installation which has versions that were used for publications; the file name includes the date.  Because I do not guarantee that future improvements will be 100% backward compatible, these versions will be mainatined.

If you want to work with the code, I suggest you contact me. The code was not written with the intention of getting to where it is now, and I am working to refactor it to make the variables names more consistent, and to eliminate duplications of code.  Unless I know someone is working on parts of the code, I might make major "improvements" that could make your life difficult.

The help file is too large to post here.  If you need it, it is online at https://www.usna.edu/Users/oceano/pguth/md_help/html/microdem.htm
