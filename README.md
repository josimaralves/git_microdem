MICRODEM help file at https://www.usna.edu/Users/oceano/pguth/md_help/html/microdem.htm

This is about 400,000 lines of Delphi code, going back to the first iteration of Turbo Pascal.  This can be compiled with the free community edition of Delphi.

If you want to work with the code, I suggest you contact me. The code was not written with the intention of getting to where it is now, and I am working to refactor it to make the variables names more consistent, and to eliminate duplications of code.  Unless I know someone is working on parts of the code, I might make major "improvements" that could make your life difficult.
